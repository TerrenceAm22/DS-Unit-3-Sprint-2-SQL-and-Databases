"How was working with MongoDB different from working with PostgreSQL? What was easier, and what was harder?"

Working with mongodb was a lot easier than Postgresql.
It was more streamlined and straightfoward atleast pertaining to the task at hand today.
I also like the UI for the website very well structured.
